# This commit removed what may have been the source xsd files:

# This is the original commit which added those xsd files and this file:
# https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/commit/de849caeb9d689ab0ffd9d8279ba0cb1af925753
# Which only indicates that Josh Blum added the files along with some from
# Ben (Reynwar?) in October 2011.
#
# This generateDS.py output file is owned by whomever owned the input xsd file.
# There is no good record of whom that is.
