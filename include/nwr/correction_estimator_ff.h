     * This block simplistically estimates offset and scaling corrections
     * for a burst of samples from the first N samples of a burst,
     * expected to be a preamble, and tags the beginning of the burst with
     * the estimated corrections.  It also tags the end of the burst to
     * indicate the end of corrections (offset of 0.0 and scale of 1.0 or
     * optionally 0.0).
     *
     * The algorithm used is the simplest possible acting on the highest
     * measured peak, and the lowest measured trough.  When that doesn't
     * work well enough, maybe I'll change it to something more sophisticated.
