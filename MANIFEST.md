gr-nwr provides an example NOAA Weather Radio receiver flowgraph for
receiving and demodulating NWR audio and SAME digitial data from any
single channel of WX1 through WX7 (162.400 - 162.550 MHz).
A description of the NWR service can be found here:
http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr 

NWR audio is narrowband FM with a 5 kHz deviation and the channels use 25 kHz
channel spacing.  The audio only goes to about 3 kHz and uses pre-emphasis.

The SAME digital encoding is AFSK in the demodulated audio.  SAME digitally
encodes emergency weather warnings.  These digital messages immediately
precede the audio for the emergency weather warnings.
Detailed specifications on SAME can be found here:

***WARNING***
DO NOT USE THIS IMPLEMENTATION FOR CRITICAL OR SAFETY OF LIFE PURPOSES.
It's just a demonstration and comes with NO WARRANTIES.

If you need reliable NWR warnings, buy a National Weather Serive approved
radio from one of these manufacturers or resellers:
