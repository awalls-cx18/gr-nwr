Example flowgraphs and data files for NWR:

1. nwr_fg.grc
   The example flowgraph for NWR audio and SAME demodulation.
   Depends on the gr-reveng OOT module for the Pattern Dump block.

2. nwr_file_prune.grc
   A utility flowgraph for snipping out segments of a large I/Q capture file.

3. rtl_sdr_capture_convert.grc
   A utility flowgraph for converting a biased 8 bit integer I and Q capture
   file, generated by the rtl_sdr utility at its default sample_rate of
   2.048 Msps, to a 32 bit float complex I and Q capture file with
   metadata headers, at a sample rate of 250 ksps, for playback with
   GNURadio's File Meta Source block.

4. nwr_band_162487500Hz_250ksps_201611091145.c32.gz
   A gzip compressed file containing 32 bit float complex I and Q and
   metadata headers.  It is an approximately 1 minute 15 second capture
   of the NWR band stations on 9 Nov 2016 at about 11:45 a.m. EST.  It
   captures a Required Weekly TEST of EAS with SAME data modulation and
   EAS tone from WXM57 Heathsville, VA on WX2 (162.400 MHz):

5. clock_recovery_test.grc
   A test flowgraph for exercising changes to the float I/O clock recovery
   block's algorithms.  You can safely ignore this flowgraph.

6. clock_recovery_test_complex.grc
   A test flowgraph for exercising changes to the complex I/O clock recovery
   block's algorithms.  You can safely ignore this flowgraph.
